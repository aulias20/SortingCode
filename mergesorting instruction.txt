Problem Description

1. Merge-sort is based on an algorithmic design pattern called divide-and-conquer.
2. It forms tree structure.
3. The height of the tree will be log(n).
4. we merge n element at every level of the tree.
5. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*log(n)).

Problem Solution

1. Split the data into two equal half until we get at most one element in both half.
2. Merge Both into one making sure the resulting sequence is sorted.
3. Recursively split them and merge on the basis of constraint given in step 1.
4. Display the result.
5. Exit.
