How it works?

1. We first pick a pivot element. There are various ways to pick a pivot element.

    Pick first element
    Pick last element
    Pick a random element
    Pick median element

So we can use anyone of above methods to pick the pivot element. In the program 
  given below I have picked first element as pivot.

2. Now all the elements smaller than pivot are placed at its left while elements 
    bigger are placed at right.

3. Repeat the above two steps recursively for both half.
