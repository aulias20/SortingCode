Let ARR is an array having N elements
1. Read ARR
2. Repeat step 3 to 6 for I=0 to N-1
3. Set MIN=ARR[I] and Set LOC=I
4. Repeat step 5 for J=I+1 to N
5. If MIN>ARR[J], then
                (a) Set MIN=ARR[J]
                (b) Set LOC=J
                [End of if]
  [End of step 4 loop]
6. Interchange ARR[I] and ARR[LOC] using temporary variable
 [End of step 2 outer loop]
7. Exit
